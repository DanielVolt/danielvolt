### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m currently working on ApexTweak's fully open-source CAN Bus Digital Dashboard, which is plug and play and works with all cars.

ðŸ’¡ The plug-and-play kit for Mazda cars will be available very soon for purchase on our website https://apextweaks.com/

ðŸš— In my free time i work on the ECU of my Audi TT 8s Simos18.1, by adjusting the mapping file to prepare for the big turbo. Currently at 320hp, 520nm.

ðŸ“« Have any questions? Mail me at danielvolt@apextweaks.com
